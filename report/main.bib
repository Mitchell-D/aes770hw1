	abstract = {Abstract A method is presented for determining the scaled optical thickness of clouds from reflected solar radiation measurements. The procedure compares measurements of the reflection function with asymptotic expressions for the reflection function of optically thick layers. Analytic formulas are derived which explicitly show the dependence of the reflection and transmission functions of nonabsorbing atmospheres, on cloud optical thickness (τc), ground albedo (Ag) and asymmetry factor (g). For nonconservative atmospheres, the dependence of the reflection function on single scattering albedo (ω0) and asymmetry factor are contained implicitly in the asymptotic functions and constants. These asymptotic expressions for both conservative and nonconservative atmosphere are shown to be valid when the scaled optical thickness (1−g)τc≥??1.45, corresponding to clouds of optical thickness τc≥??9. By utilizing the asymptotic expression for the reflection function of an optically thick, conservatively scattering atmosphere. a simple expression is obtained relating the measured reflection function to scaled optical thickness. This expression shows that the ground albedo produces a constant bias in the derived optical thickness, regardless of the value of the measured reflection function. High-resolution images of the reflection function of clouds have been obtained with a multichannel scanning radiometer operated from a high-altitude aircraft. An image of the reflection function of clouds obtained from a stratiform cloud system in central Oklahoma is analyzed using two different phase functions. Results show that details of the single scattering phase function have an impact on the derived optical thickness, although the dominant influence is the cloud asymmetry factor which appears explicitly in the analysis.},

	abstract = {Abstract A multiwavelength scanning radiometer has been used to measure the angular distribution of scattered radiation deep within a cloud layer at discrete wavelengths between 0.5 and 2.3 μm. The relative angular distribution of the intensity field at each wavelength is used to determine the similarity parameter, and hence single scattering albedo, of the cloud at that wavelength using the diffusion domain method. In addition to the spectral similarity parameter, the analysis provides a good estimate of the optical thickness of the cloud beneath the aircraft. Results of such analysis are presented for a 50 km section of clean marine stratocumulus clouds off the coast of California on 10 July 1987. These observations were obtained from the University of Washington Convair C-131A aircraft as part of the First ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) Regional Experiment (FIRE). In addition to the radiation measurements, we obtained microphysical and thermodynamic measurements from which the expected similarity parameter spectrum was calculated using accepted values of the refractive index of liquid water and the transmission function of water vapor. The measured absorption for this case of clean maritime clouds is close to, but persistently larger than, theoretical predictions. Finally, measurements are presented of the spectral albedo of the ocean surface under overcast conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract A method is presented for determining the single scattering albedo of clouds at selected wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared wavelength regions. The procedure compares measurements of the ratio of the zenith to nadir propagating intensifies deep within a cloud layer with radiative transfer computations of the same. Analytic formulas are derived which explicitly show the dependence of the internal intensity ratio on ground albedo, optical depth, single scattering albedo and cloud asymmetry factor. The single scattering albedo and cloud asymmetry factor enter the solution in such a way that a similarity relationship exists between these two parameters. As a result, the accuracy with which the single scattering albedo can be determined is dictated by the accuracy with which the asymmetry factor can be estimated. A method of observation is described whereby aircraft measurements of the zenith and nadir propagating intensifies can be used to determine the similarity parameter as a function of wavelength. Since the fractional absorption of a cloud depends on the similarity parameter and not on the single scattering albedo and asymmetry factor separately, this poses no severe limitation to the method. An accurate knowledge of the ground albedo and total optical thickness of a cloud are unnecessary for a solution, provided one associates the wavelength for which the intensity ratio is a maximum with conservative scattering. Under this internal calibration approach, uncertainties in the ground albedo are very nearly compensated by uncertainties in the cloud optical thickness.},

This day was particularly advantageous for validations because of the absence of cirrus or other higher-level clouds during the satellite overpass and the existence of a large relatively uniform stratus cloud dock. Uncertainty estimates for the retrievals are presented along with a discussion of the algorithm. An in-flight absolute calibration of AVHRR channel 1, necessary for accurate optical thickness retrievals, was done concurrently with the retrievals through comparison with a visible radiometer flown on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's ER-2 and using the stratus cloud as the common reflectance target. Results are compared with in situ microphysical measurements taken with the Particulate Volume Monitor (PVM-100) and Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP-100) instruments on the University of Washington C-131A air-craft.

The computations were obtained by successive applications of the invariant imbedding, doubling and asymptotic fitting methods to cover the range from very thin to very thick atmospheres. Results are presented which illustrate the magnitude of the separate terms in the Fourier expansion of the phase function and the Fourier expansion of the reflection function of a semi-infinite atmosphere as a function of the zenith angles of incidence and reflection. The azimuthally independent reflection function is enhanced by as much as a factor of 115 over the first-order reflection function, whereas the azimuth-dependent reflection functions generally result from less multiple scattering. These results are compared with those for an atmosphere having a Henyey-Greenstein phase function with the same asymmetry factor (g = 0.84123) as in the cloud model. The relative difference in the escape function and azimuthally independent reflection function is generally less than a few per cent, though differences up to 70\% occur in the reflection function at angles where single scattering is important. Results are also presented which show the number of terms required in the Fourier expansion of the reflection function to be assured an accuracy of 0.1\%. The number of terms required depends strongly on the zenith angles of incidence and reflections as well as on details of the phase function.},

The criterion of asymptotic sufficiency which has been called "second order efficiency" is rejected as a criterion of goodness of estimate as against some loss function such as the mean squared error. The relation between MLE and sufficiency is not assured, as illustrated in an example in which MLE yields ∞ as estimate with samples that have different values of the sufficient statistic. Other examples are cited in which minimal sufficient statistics exist but where the MLE is not sufficient.

	abstract = {Abstract Remote sensing instruments are heavily used to provide observations for both the operational and research communities. These sensors do not provide direct observations of the desired atmospheric variables, but instead, retrieval algorithms are necessary to convert the indirect observations into the variable of interest. It is critical to be aware of the underlying assumptions made by many retrieval algorithms, including that the retrieval problem is often ill posed and that there are various sources of uncertainty that need to be treated properly. In short, the retrieval challenge is to invert a set of noisy observations to obtain estimates of atmospheric quantities. The problem is often complicated by imperfect forward models, by imperfect prior knowledge, and by the existence of nonunique solutions. Optimal estimation (OE) is a widely used physical retrieval method that combines measurements, prior information, and the corresponding uncertainties based on Bayes’s theorem to find an optimal solution for the atmospheric state. Furthermore, OE also allows the relative contributions of the different sources of error to the uncertainty in the final retrieved atmospheric state to be understood. Here, we provide a novel Python library to illustrate the use of OE for inverse problems in the atmospheric sciences. We introduce two example problems: how to retrieve drop size distribution parameters from radar observations and how to retrieve the temperature profile from ground-based microwave sensors. Using these examples, we discuss common pitfalls, how the various error sources impact the retrieval, and how the quality of the retrieval results can be quantified.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper investigates the important difference in the relationship between brightness temperatures between the 11-μm and the 12-μn AVHRR data and the microphysical properties of the semitransparent cirrus clouds. In the nonscattering approximation, the emittance for channels 4 and 5 are related through the absorption coefficient ratio that is the key parameter giving access to the size of cloud particles. The observed mean value of this parameter corresponds to effective radius of 18 μm for polydisperse spheres and 12 μm for polydisperse infinitely long ice cylinders. Taking the multiple scattering into account, the brightness temperature difference enhances much more for cylinders than for spheres owing to the fact that the forward peak of scattering is less large for cylinders. To obtain the size of cloud particles, the method developed in the nonscattering case is still applicable if one makes use of the effective emittance that implicitly includes the effects of mattering. Thus, an effective absorption coefficient ratio is defined and we derive a direct relationship between this ratio and the optical properties of the cloud particles. The mean value of the effective absorption coefficient ratio corresponds to ice spheres of effective radius of 26 μm or a bit less in the case of water spheres (supercooled droplets), but no agreement can be obtained for fully randomly oriented cylinders.},

This paper presents the CPP algorithm and determines if SEVIRI can be used together with AVHRR to build a consistent and accurate data set of cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud liquid water path (CLWP) over Europe for climate research purposes. After quantifying the differences in 0.6 and 1.6 μm operational calibrated reflectances of SEVIRI and AVHRR, a recalibration procedure is proposed to normalize and absolutely calibrate these reflectances. The effects of recalibration, spatial resolution, and viewing geometry differences on the SEVIRI and AVHRR cloud property retrievals are evaluated. The intercomparison of 0.6 and 1.6 μm operationally calibrated reflectances indicates ∼6 and ∼26\% higher reflectances for SEVIRI than for AVHRR. These discrepancies result in retrieval differences between AVHRR and SEVIRI of ∼8\% for COT and ∼60\% for CLWP. Owing to recalibration these differences reduce to ∼5\%, while the magnitude of the median COT and CLWP values of AVHRR decrease ∼2 and ∼60\% and the SEVIRI values increase ∼10 and ∼55\%, respectively. The differences in spatial resolution and viewing geometry slightly influence the retrieval precision. Thus the CPP algorithm can be used to build a consistent and high-quality data set of SEVIRI and AVHRR retrieved cloud properties for climate research purposes, provided the instrument reflectances are recalibrated, preferably guided by the satellite operators.},

	abstract = {We present results that demonstrate the effects of Rayleigh scattering on the retrieval of cloud optical thickness at a visible wavelength (0.66 μm). The sensor-measured radiance at a visible wavelength (0.66 μm) is usually used to infer remotely the cloud optical thickness from aircraft or satellite instruments. For example, we find that without removing Rayleigh scattering effects, errors in the retrieved cloud optical thickness for a thin water cloud layer (τc=2.0) range from 15 to 60\%, depending on solar zenith angle and viewing geometry. For an optically thick cloud (τc≳10), on the other hand, errors can range from 10 to 60\% for large solar zenith angles (θ0≳60°) because of enhanced Rayleigh scattering. It is therefore particularly important to correct for Rayleigh scattering contributions to the reflected signal from a cloud layer both (1) for the case of thin clouds and (2) for large solar zenith angles and all clouds. On the basis of the single scattering approximation, we propose an iterative method for effectively removing Rayleigh scattering contributions from the measured radiance signal in cloud optical thickness retrievals. The proposed correction algorithm works very well and can easily be incorporated into any cloud retrieval algorithm. The Rayleigh correction method is applicable to cloud at any pressure, providing that the cloud top pressure is known to within ±100 hPa. With the Rayleigh correction the errors in retrieved cloud optical thickness are usually reduced to within 3\%. In cases of both thin cloud layers and thick clouds with large solar zenith angles, the errors are usually reduced by a factor of about 2 to over 10. The Rayleigh correction algorithm has been tested with simulations for realistic cloud optical and microphysical properties with different solar and viewing geometries. We apply the Rayleigh correction algorithm to the cloud optical thickness retrievals from experimental data obtained during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX) conducted near the Azores in June 1992 and compare these results to corresponding retrievals obtained using 0.88 μm. These results provide an example of the Rayleigh scattering effects on thin clouds and further test the Rayleigh correction scheme. Using a nonabsorbing near-infrared wavelength (0.88 μm) in retrieving cloud optical thickness is only applicable over oceans, however, since most land surfaces are highly reflective at 0.88 μm. Hence successful global retrievals of cloud optical thickness should remove Rayleigh scattering effects when using reflectance measurements at 0.66 μm.},

	abstract = {Abstract A new parameterization is presented for the shortwave radiative properties of water clouds, which is fast enough to be included in general circulation models (GCMs). It employs the simple relationships found by Slingo and Schrecker for the optical depth, single scatter albedo and asymmetry parameter of cloud drops as function of the cloud liquid water path and equivalent radius of the drop size distribution. The cloud radiative properties are then obtained from standard two-stream equations for a homogeneous layer. The effect of water vapor absorption within the cloud is ignored in this version, leading to a small underestimate of the cloud absorption. The parameterization is compared with other schemes and with aircraft observations. It performs satisfactorily even when only four spectral bands are employed. The explicit separation of the dependence of the derived cloud radiative properties on the liquid water path and equivalent radius is new, and should prove valuable for climate change investigations.},

        abstract = {Abstract A method is presented for determining the optical thickness and effective particle radius of stratiform cloud layers from reflected solar radiation measurements. A detailed study is presented which shows that the cloud optical thickness (τc) and effective particle radius (re) of water clouds can be determined solely from reflection function measurements at 0.75 and 2.16 μm, provided τc ≳ 4 and re ≳ 6 μm. For optically thin clouds the retrieval becomes ambiguous, resulting in two possible solutions for the effective radius and optical thickness. Adding a third channel near 1.65 μm does not improve the situation noticeably, whereas the addition of a channel near 3.70 μm reduces the ambiguity in deriving the effective radius. The effective radius determined by the above procedure corresponds to the droplet radius at some optical depth within the cloud layer. For clouds having τc ≳ 8, the effective radius determined using the 0.75 and 2.16 μm channels can be regarded as 85\%–95\% of the radius at cloud top, which corresponds in turn to an optical depth 20\%–40\% of the total optical thickness of the cloud layer.},
